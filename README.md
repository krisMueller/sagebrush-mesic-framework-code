# sagebrush-mesic-framework-code
This repository contains the data and analytical scripts used to generate the conservation framework presented in the manuscript "Beyond Uplands." The analysis integrates riparian (mesic) ecosystem data with the Sagebrush Conservation Design (SCD) to prioritize watersheds for protection, restoration, and management.
